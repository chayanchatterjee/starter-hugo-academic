# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Dr. Chayan Chatterjee is the A.I. for New Messengers Postdoctoral Fellow at Vanderbilt University. His research focuses on application of artificial intelligence to study gravitational waves - tiny ripples in space-time created by colliding black holes and neutron stars. Besides all things astronomy, he is passionate about literature, films, photography and travelling.

I am the A.I. for New Messengers Postdoctoral Fellow at Vanderbilt University, USA, a position jointly offered by the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Data Science Institute at Vanderbilt University. I obtained my PhD in Physics from The University of Western Australia in 2023, where I worked on developing deep learning models for rapid detection and sky localization of [gravitational wave](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-are-gw) sources. My current research focuses on applying [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) for gravitational wave data analysis and inference from both individual and populations of sources.

I grew up in West Bengal, India, where I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Physics from Presidency University, Kolkata. During my Masters, I worked on the impact of  [self-interacting dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05658) on cosmological large-scale structure formation. I am passionate about science communication and public outreach, having delivered several public talks and participated in science talk shows and podcasts. In addition to my interests in astronomy and physics, I enjoy reading, creative writing, films, and traveling.
