summary: Application of deep learning algorithms for denoising binary black hole gravitational waves and estimating their source properties.
abstract: 'In the era of multi-messenger astronomy, it is imperative to conduct rapid estimation of the masses and sky directions of gravitational wave sources for prompt electromagnetic follow-up observations. However, currently used Bayesian parameter estimation techniques by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration are not fast enough to enable detections of electromagnetic signatures arising during or just after the merger of the binary system.
In this talk, I give an overview of efforts conducted using deep learning algorithms for fast likelihood-free inference of gravitational wave source parameters at comparable accuracy to the optimal Bayesian inference results. I discuss deep learning techniques for extraction of binary black hole gravitational wave signals from noise and applications of the method for accurate sky localization and chirp mass estimation.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).
